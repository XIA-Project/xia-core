# FIXME:
# the locaitons of the various service executables makes this script fragile
# as they all currently have to run from the directory they are located in
# in order to use the correct xsockconf.ini file. It would be good to 
# a) relocate the services into a common directory instead of being scattered
# throughout the source tree
# b) not rely on the xsockconf.ini file if possible
