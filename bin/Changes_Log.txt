Changes in xiaconfigurator.py


Make changes in routerclick.py, rename the file and change the class name to RouterFilegen

1. Line 34 - routerclick changed to routerfilegen (only name change, no click functionality is being used)
2. Line 34 - RouterClick changed to RouterFilegen (name of class changed in routerfilegen.py as well)
3. Line 104 - Class name change to RouterFilegen

Note:

routerclick.py file had a class called RouterClick. Both filename as well as class name has been changed as mentioned above.
This file seems to generate a file by concatinating many fields to the routers for config (Line 113 and 114).
No click functionality is being used here so only file name has been changed to remove confusion for the clickless system.

No other changes in xiaconfigurator.py file. Rest of the code has no click. Major changes in xroute file.


Changes in xiaconfighelper.py

1. Line 24 - ROUTER_CLICK changed to ROUTER_FILE - need to change in xiaconfigdefs.py
2. Line 53 - same change

Note:

router.click file is being used to generate nodes.conf file which is sent back to the overlay controller.
nodes.conf is needed while bootup. The router.click file contents seem to be the same as generated 
in routerclick.py (now routerfilegen.py) file. Since no click is used here and it is only naming convention, 
it is retained as is. Can change router.click filename to something else? Need to make same changes in xiaconfigdefs.py
Line 58 - print statement still says click

Changes in xroute.py

addRoute and deleteRoute has been updated in order to call the forwarding table object file to add/remove
routes from the forwarding table. Comments in the file describe the changes and implementation

forwarding_tale.cpp

This file has the hash table implementation to add/remove routes from the forwarding table. The forwading table is written into a file
and manipulated when add or remove functions are called. Comments describe implementation in detail. The executable of this program is called in xroute
