XIA API documentation

Documentation for the XIA APIs is available as web and man pages.

To generate the documentation ensure that the doxygen package is installed
on your system. Then run 'make doc' from the xia-core directory.

HTML pages will be placed in xia-core/doc/html

The doc/xdocs command will launch a browser with the documentation, or they
can be navigated to with your preferred browser.


man pages will be placed in xia-core/doc/html

The doc/xiaman command can be used to display the XIA specific man pages.

Alternately, add the following line to your .bashrc or .zshrc file to access
the XIA man pages with the default man command.

export MANPATH=$MANPATH:~/xia-core/doc/man
