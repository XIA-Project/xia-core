                   CLICK NETWORK VISUALIZER

This flashed-based tool displays traffic flowing through a network of click XIA
elements. There are three components that work together:

	1) 	xia-core/daemons/visualizer/stasserver

		One instance of this executable must be run for the entire network. It
		aggregates information from each host running click; the visualizer
		periodically queries the statsserver for this information.

		Passing the "-Z" flag to xia-core/tools/xianet will start the statsserver
		for you.

	2)	xia-core/daemons/visualizer/xstats

		Each instance of click (typically one per physical host or VM) needs an
		accompanying instance of the xstats daemon. xstats periodically extracts
		routing and traffic flow information from click and pushes it to the
		statsserver. The IP address or hostname of the machine running the
		statsserver must be supplied to xstats.

		Passing the "-z <server ip>" flag to xia-core/tools/xianet will start
		the xstats daemon.

	3)	xia-core/visualizations/distributed_click/Visualizer.html

		This is the visualizer itself. Open Visualizer.html in a browswer that
		supports flash. Make sure that Visualizer.swf is in the same directory
		as Visualizer.html.

		Supply the address and port of the statsserver and click "Start."
		For example, the address might be:

		http://localhost:8888

		Flash might proudly declare that it blocked unsafe behavior; to fix this,
