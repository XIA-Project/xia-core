The XIA Inspector colors all XIA dag URLs green and adds a button to the top
right corner of your web browser; clicking it toggles the inspector. Currently
the inspector simply shows a graphical representation of any DAG URL under the
mouse; functionality may be extended in the future.


FIREFOX
1) Install Greasemonkey (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey)
2) In Firefox, open the file "xia-inspector.user.js". Greasemonkey will prompt you to click "Install"
3) To allow Greasemonkey to apply the XIA inspector to local html files, type "about:config" in the address bar and change the value of greasemonkey.fileIsGreaseable to true

CHROME
1) Open the file "xia-inspector.user.js" from Chrome and click "OK" when prompted.
2) I'm not currently aware of a way to make Chrome apply the XIA inspector to local HTML files
