Tinyftp is a small ftp server. It implements a set of all 
the neccessary  commands for performing the main actions, 
suppported by the protocol. The server is based on rfc959. 
This server does not support "passive" mode, because it needs
a simultaneous communication on a custom free port for 
additional data transfers. For this we will need an IPC, which
hardens the implementation a lot.
The only valid user, that can log in is "anonymous", because of 
the different authentication mechanism on different platforms.
All server options are set from the command line parameters.

"tyniftp -h " - is for a short help message.

This server is tested to run on linux, but maybe it is
applicable to all unixes. If a platform supports system 
calls "fork" and "setreuid" and posix type octed permissions 
mostly it will not have problems running this server. 
On a SYST question this server is identified like "UNIX".
