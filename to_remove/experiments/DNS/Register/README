This directory provides the XregisterName function along with a small tester
program. This function allows users to register a name with the currently
running BIND namserver. It uses the nsupdate command which is compiled along
with named. named places restrictions on which names can be registered and who
can register names. These restrictions are based on the zone files in
/var/named/.
