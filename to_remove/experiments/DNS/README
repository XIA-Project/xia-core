-------------------
 Directory Roadmap
-------------------

./bind-9.8.1/ contains code for the BIND nameserver (its executable is called 
        named) and associated tools.
./bind_demo_conf/ contains sample BIND configuration files. named.conf should
        be placed in /etc/ while the other files go in /var/named
./demo_setup.sh Will configure and compile the bind nameserver and all
        necessary tools
./Register/ contains a function that could be used to register names with BIND
./XIAResolver/ contains a function (XgetDAGbyName) that communicates with named
        to get the DAG associated with the given domain name


-----------------------------
 Installing and Running BIND
-----------------------------

Run ./demo_setup.sh to compile, setup, and run the nameserver. The Xsocket
library must first be correctly linked into the BIND files. Used the named
command to start the BIND nameserver in the background (use named -f to start
in the foreground). This command must be run as root. Various functions of the
nameserver can be tested using the ./tester scripts in ./Register/ and
./XIAResolver/. 


------------------------
 Communicating Over XDP
------------------------

BIND has been editted to communicate over XDP instead of UDP. Sockets usually
listening on UDP in the named process will now listen over XDP. UDP connections
are no longer used. Specifically, only the named and nsupdate code, along with
the underlying socket code has been editted. Other programs using non-XIA
protocols should still compile and work correctly as long as they're linked
with the XIA libraries.

To successfully run named, an xsockconf.ini file must be added to the
/var/named directory (demo_setup.sh does this).


---------------------
 Storing XIA Records
---------------------

(Details on addition of xia_65532.c and xia_65532.h at
    bind-9.8.1/lib/dns/rdata/generic)

XIA DAG RR naively stores dag string, nothing special
using type number 65532 <- temporary

configure, make, make install
no extra configuration required

sample setup in bind_sample_conf folder
  - named.conf -> /etc/named.conf
  - example.com.zone -> /var/example.com.zon
  - localhost.zone -> /var/localhost.zone

testing getxiadstdagbyname() <- for getting xia destination DAG
make XIAResolver/
run XIAResolver/tester
type 'example.com' for testing <- gets dns RR from local dns server
                                  (127.0.0.1 #53)
