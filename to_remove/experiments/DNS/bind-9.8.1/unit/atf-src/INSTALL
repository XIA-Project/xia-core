Installation instructions                       Automated Testing Framework
===========================================================================


Introduction
************

ATF uses the GNU Automake, GNU Autoconf and GNU Libtool utilities as its
build system.  These are used only when compiling the application from the
source code package.  If you want to install ATF from a binary package, you
do not need to read this document.

For the impatient:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  Gain root privileges
  # make install
  Drop root privileges
  $ make installcheck

Or alternatively, install as a regular user into your home directory:

  $ ./configure --prefix ~/local
  $ make
  $ make install
  $ make installcheck


Dependencies
************

To build and use ATF successfully you need:

* A standards-compliant C/C++ complier.  For example, GNU GCC 2.95 will not
  work.

* A POSIX shell interpreter.

* A make(1) utility.

If you are building ATF from the code on the repository, you will also need
the following tools.  The versions listed here are the ones used to build
the files bundled in the last formal release, but these are not strictly
required.  Newer ones will most likely work and, maybe, some slightly older
ones:

* GNU autoconf 2.68

* GNU automake 1.11.1

* GNU libtool 2.2.6b


Regenerating the build system
*****************************

If you are building ATF from code extracted from the repository, you must
first regenerate the files used by the build system.  You will also need to
do this if you modify configure.ac, Makefile.am or any of the other build
system files.  To do this, simply run:

  $ autoreconf -i -s

For formal releases, no extra steps are needed.


General build procedure
***********************

To build and install the source package, you must follow these steps:

1. Configure the sources to adapt to your operating system.  This is done
   using the 'configure' script located on the sources' top directory,
   and it is usually invoked without arguments unless you want to change
   the installation prefix.  More details on this procedure are given on a
   later section.

2. Build the sources to generate the binaries and scripts.  Simply run
   'make' on the sources' top directory after configuring them.  No
   problems should arise.

3. Install the program by running 'make install'.  You may need to become
   root to issue this step.

4. Issue any manual installation steps that may be required.  These are
   described later in their own section.

5. Check that the installed programs work by running 'make installcheck'.
   You do not need to be root to do this, even though some checks will not
   be run otherwise.


Configuration flags
*******************

The most common, standard flags given to 'configure' are:

* --prefix=directory
  Possible values: Any path
  Default: /usr/local

  Specifies where the program (binaries and all associated files) will
  be installed.

* --sysconfdir=directory
  Possible values: Any path
  Default: /usr/local/etc

  Specifies where the installed programs will look for configuration files.
  '/atf' will be appended to the given path unless ATF_CONFSUBDIR is
  redefined as explained later on.

* --help
  Shows information about all available flags and exits immediately,
  without running any configuration tasks.

The following environment variables are specific to ATF's 'configure'
script:

* ATF_BUILD_CC
  Possible values: empty, a absolute or relative path to a C compiler.
  Default: the value of CC as detected by the configure script.

  Specifies the C compiler that ATF will use at run time whenever the
  build-time-specific checks are used.

* ATF_BUILD_CFLAGS
  Possible values: empty, a list of valid C compiler flags.
  Default: the value of CFLAGS as detected by the configure script.

  Specifies the C compiler flags that ATF will use at run time whenever the
  build-time-specific checks are used.

* ATF_BUILD_CPP
  Possible values: empty, a absolute or relative path to a C/C++
  preprocessor.
  Default: the value of CPP as detected by the configure script.

  Specifies the C/C++ preprocessor that ATF will use at run time whenever
  the build-time-specific checks are used.

* ATF_BUILD_CPPFLAGS
  Possible values: empty, a list of valid C/C++ preprocessor flags.
  Default: the value of CPPFLAGS as detected by the configure script.

  Specifies the C/C++ preprocessor flags that ATF will use at run time
  whenever the build-time-specific checks are used.

* ATF_BUILD_CXX
  Possible values: empty, a absolute or relative path to a C++ compiler.
  Default: the value of CXX as detected by the configure script.

  Specifies the C++ compiler that ATF will use at run time whenever the
  build-time-specific checks are used.

* ATF_BUILD_CXXFLAGS
  Possible values: empty, a list of valid C++ compiler flags.
  Default: the value of CXXFLAGS as detected by the configure script.

  Specifies the C++ compiler flags that ATF will use at run time whenever
  the build-time-specific checks are used.

* ATF_CONFSUBDIR
  Possible values: empty, a relative path.
  Default: atf.

  Specifies the subdirectory of the configuration directory (given by the
  --sysconfdir argument) under which ATF will search for its configuration
  files.

* ATF_SHELL
  Possible values: empty, absolute path to a POSIX shell interpreter.
  Default: empty.

  Specifies the POSIX shell interpreter that ATF will use at run time to
  execute its scripts and the test programs written using the atf-sh
  library.  If empty, the configure script will try to find a suitable
  interpreter for you.

* ATF_WORKDIR
  Possible values: empty, an absolute path.
  Default: /tmp or /var/tmp, depending on availability.

  Specifies the directory that ATF will use to place its temporary files
  and work directories for test cases.  This is just a default and can be
  overriden at run time.

The following flags are specific to ATF's 'configure' script:

* --enable-developer
  Possible values: yes, no
  Default: Depends on the version number.  Stable versions define this to
  'no' while all others have it set to 'yes'.

  Enables several features useful for development, such as the inclusion of
  debugging symbols in all objects or the enabling of warnings during
  compilation.

* --enable-unstable-shared
  Possible values: yes, no
  Default: no.

  Forces the building of shared libraries in addition to static ones.  The
  build of shared libraries is currently disabled because their ABIs and
  APIs are unstable and subject to change.  This flag is provided for
  development purposes only and will be removed once the libraries are
  stable enough.


Post-installation steps
***********************

After installing ATF, you have to register the DTDs it provides into the
system-wide XML catalog.  See the comments at the top of the files in
${datadir}/share/xml/atf to see the correct public identifiers.  This
directory will typically be /usr/local/share/xml/atf or /usr/share/xml/atf.
Failure to do so will lead to further errors when processing the XML files
generated by atf-report.
